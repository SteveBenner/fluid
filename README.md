I love the concept of personalizing your web experience - here is where I've made a tiny start.

# Fluid
So I'm of the opinion that [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) is the best thing since prettymuch ever. Not only can it take your favorite website and put it into a mac-flavored box. Additionally, you get to tack on your own CSS and JavaScript; imagine the possibilities!

### Hydronamic
I've started a micro library for editing Fluid app styles and scripts. Maybe it will become a gem someday.

## Development Tools
-  Compass/SASS
-  CoffeeScript
