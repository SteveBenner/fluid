# Fluid
[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/). Take your favorite website, and make it an app. Genius? Yes. Addicting? Completely.

## Resources

### Icons
Sometimes when I make an app, the favicon offered by its website is high-quality enough that I'm satisfied using it as the app icon. This usually isn't the case though, so more often than not I find myself turning to the interwebs for a suitable PNG. Here I share [my collection]. Icon previews are generated by running the script `generate-previews.rb`.

### User styles and scripts  
I've only just touched the surface of Fluid's vast potential for customizing web apps using CSS and JS, but this is truly my favorite feature of the software. My slight edits to daily essentials such as Gmail have already enhanced my experience so much, that I can see myself pouring hours into further app modifications.

#### Developer Tip!  
You can make your website Fluid-friendly by providing a nice high-def icon via a simple LINK tag. Example:

    <link rel="fluid-icon" href="image-URI" title="app-name" />

> Set the `rel` to `fluid-icon`, the `href` to the high-res image location, and the `title` to the proposed application title and you're done! ([source](http://davidwalsh.name/fluid-app))

I'm surprised this bears no mention on the [official site developer page], but it's a nice touch.

## Hydronamic
I've started a micro library to act as an object-oriented interface for editing Fluid app styles and scripts. Maybe it will become a gem someday. For now it sits here.
