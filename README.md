# Internet Hacks
This is a collection of fun little scripts and styles I use to customize my personal internet experience.

# Software
### Fluid
I use [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) extremely heavily, on a day-to-day basis. It allows one to apply user scripts and styles to the browser engine, allowing customization of any website contained in the app.

### Dotcss
[dotcss](https://github.com/stewart/dotcss) is a unique little piece of software that sits a tiny server in your Chrome environment, and loads arbitrary user scripts/styles upon matching a web URL, similar to the functionality of Fluid except integrated directly with Chrome so that literally any website is a viable candidate for customization.
