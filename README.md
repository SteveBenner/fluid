# Fluid
[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/). Take your favorite website, and make it an app. Genius? Yes. Addicting? Completely.

## Resources

### Icons
Unless the default favicon for its website is particularly excellent, when I make a new Fluid app I go find the highest quality icon available on the web and use that. I figured that I might as well sync-n-share my collection. These icons are probably useful for other things, but as I'm just using them for Fluid they can chill here in this repo.

### User styles and scripts  
Sometimes when I make an app, the favicon offered by its website is high-quality enough to use off-the-bat; usually this isn't the case though. More often than not, I find myself looking to the interwebs for a suitable PNG--here I share [my collection].

#### Developer Tip!  
You can make your website Fluid-friendly by providing a nice high-def icon via a simple LINK tag. Example:

    <link rel="fluid-icon" href="image-URI" title="app-name" />

> Set the `rel` to `fluid-icon`, the `href` to the high-res image location, and the `title` to the proposed application title and you're done! ([source](http://davidwalsh.name/fluid-app))

I'm surprised this bears no mention on the [official site developer page], but it's a nice touch.

## Hydronamic
I've started a micro library to act as an object-oriented interface for editing Fluid app styles and scripts. Maybe it will become a gem someday. For now it sits here.
