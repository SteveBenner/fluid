# TODO
- re-organize repo and clean
- update for v2

## FEATURE IDEAS
- make an `init` script that on running without flags simply symlinks your `FluidApps` directory to `/Applications/`, but with `-l` flag generates symlinks for each of your apps into your `/Applications` directory, in the same way `brew cask` does.

## App customizations (see individual files for detail)
- Easings-Mini
- Toggl-Mini
- Soundcloud
