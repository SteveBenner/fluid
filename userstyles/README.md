# Wat It Do

### Facebook
- Most if not all ads are POOF gone, and so is the right content bar
- Feed posts are widened substantially and 'sponsored' ones are hidden

### Gmail

- Email drafts have larger text and a nicer font
- Removed the glaring, obnoxious 'browser not supported' banner at the top of the window

### Google Contacts

- The left sidebar is now wider, so a larger portion of the names of contact groups can be seen

### LastFM
- Cut out extraneous content such as the footer and sidebar

### Mind Meister
**TODO:**

- toolbar enhancements
- custom backgrounds
